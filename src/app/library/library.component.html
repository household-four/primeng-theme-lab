<p>library works!</p>
I think the library should display a small window for each theme in the styles folder. 
Later we can implement a way to store themes in a server, but for now people can upload them to the repo.
Theme files will get approved and merged in, and then you can go to the library page to see each of them. 
The window should have enough of a sample of things in it that you can preview how the theme looks.
